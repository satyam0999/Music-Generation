# Music Generation with RNNs


#Irish Folk Music Generation with RNN
Welcome to our Irish Folk Music Generation project! In this project, we explore the fascinating world of Irish folk songs represented in the ABC notation. We aim to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to learn the intricate patterns within these musical notations and use the trained model to generate new, authentic pieces of Irish folk music.

#Getting Started

#Dataset
We have assembled a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of Irish folk songs in ABC notation. To get started, download the dataset and take a closer look to understand its structure.

#ABC Notation to Audio
Explore the capability to convert a song in ABC notation to an audio waveform and play it back. This functionality allows you to audibly experience the beauty of Irish folk music.

#Model Training

1.Vectorize the Text
Before diving into training the RNN model, we need to create a numerical representation of our text-based dataset. This involves generating two lookup tables: one mapping characters to numbers and another mapping numbers back to characters.

2.Create Training Examples and Targets
Divide the text into example sequences, each containing a specified sequence length of characters. Define target sequences for each input sequence, essential for training the RNN to predict the next character.

3.RNN Model Architecture
Our model is based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. It utilizes an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense output layer. The model is designed to capture temporal relationships between consecutive characters and generate a softmax distribution over the vocabulary to predict the next character.

4.Training the Model
Train the RNN model using batches of song snippets from the dataset. The training process involves minimizing the sparse categorical crossentropy loss, optimizing the model to predict the next character accurately.

#Music Generation
1.Generating Music with the Trained Model
Now that the model is trained, let's use it to generate new Irish folk music! Provide a seed to initiate the generation process, and iteratively predict each successive character using the trained RNN. The generated music is then encoded in ABC format.

2.Restore the Latest Checkpoint
To simplify the inference step, we use a batch size of 1. If you wish to run the model with a different batch size, rebuild the model and restore the weights from the latest checkpoint.

#How to Use
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the provided notebooks to explore, train, and generate Irish folk music using our RNN model.

Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, dataset sizes, and model architectures to create unique musical compositions!

Happy music generation! ðŸŽ¶
