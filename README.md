# Music Generation with RNNs

In the second part of this lab, we delve into the exciting realm of building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) tailored for music generation. Specifically, we employ a "character RNN" to predict the subsequent characters in sheet music using ABC notation. The ultimate goal is to leverage this model to sample and create an entirely novel music file, unheard of before!
